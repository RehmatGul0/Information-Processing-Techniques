Question No 1: String Reversal Server using SocketsThe problem is to implement a client -server application using sockets API in C#. The Server application has to support at least five clients simultaneously. Server accepts strings from clients (even multiple strings from each client) and replies with reverse strings. For example, when client sends “WORLD”, Server replies with “DLROW”. Both server and client(s) have to output both sending & receiving strings on the terminal.  The  server  and  client  processes  should  be able  to run  on  different  machines.When  the  client application writes “exit”, then it would terminate the client only.

Question No 2: Email WriterWrite a windows form application where user can write an email through a UI. User would be able to write the ‘To email address’, ‘Subject’and ‘Message’to send.Once the user has filled-in all of the details, he or she will press the send button,which will generate an XML file per email. Make sure, user should may not accidently  press  the  submit  button  twice.Allof the  xml  files  will  be  stored  in  a  folder defined  in  the configuration file (app.config) . XML output format will be as following:<EmailMessage><To></To><Subject></Subject><MessageBody></MessageBody></EmailMessage>

Question No 3: SMTP Windows ServiceYou  have  multiple  applications  that  need  to  send  emails  to  recipients.  You  are  required  to  create  a centralized  application which  could send emails using SMTP. Create a  windows service which reads  an XML  file  after  every  15 minutes from a  fixed  location  and  sends  email  to  the  receipts.  The  XML input should same as in Question No 2:Note: Email configurations should be included in a configuration file (app.config).

Question No 4: RSS Feed Windows ServiceRSS   feeds  enable   publisherstosyndicatedata  automatically.   A   standardXMLfile  format   ensures compatibility with many different machines/programs. RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive timely updates from favorite websites or to aggregate data from many sites. You are required to create a Windows Service which reads RSS feeds every 5 minutes from any two of the Pakistani NewsWeb Site. The output should be stored in one xml file sorted in descending order of date/time.At every interval, It will overwrite the contents of the file.The output format should be similar to what is shown below:<NewsItem><Title></Title><Description></Description><PublishedDate></PublishedDate><NewsChannel></NewsChannel></NewsItem>

Question No 5: Folder Monitor Windows ServiceFolder  Monitor  client  is  supposed  to  track  changes  on  a  specific  folder.  You  are  required  to  create  two windows services:a)First service is supposed to check the specified folder every minute for any changes. If there are any  changes,  it  should  copy  the  new  or  updated  files  to  another  fixed  location.  If  there  are  no changes then it should increase the delay by additional 2 minutes until it reaches 1-hour delay. The delay should not exceed 1-hour gap.b)Second  service  is  supposed  to  send  email  to  the  local  user  (email  address  would  be  in  the configuration file). This service will check for changes in the specified folder every 15 minutes and if there is any change, it will notify the user with the filenameand file Size.
